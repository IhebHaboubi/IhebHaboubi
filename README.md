# Hello, Friend.

### About 

I'm **Iheb**, a computer science student. Programming and solving challenging problems is one of my multiple hobbies.
I'm currently practicing algorithms and data structures :floppy_disk:. I've also started contributing to open source software :octocat: which has been an amazing learning experience.
I'm very eager to dive into computer vision, reinforecement learning, and robotics software engineering in general :robot:.

So, If you share the same interests as me, let me know and maybe we can work on something cool !
Also if you have any question, don't hesitate to ask me :rainbow:
